I am currently a PhD candidate in Agricultural Economics at TAMU. I possess a profound knowledge of economic and finance theories, including industrial organization, auction theory, labor economics, and portfolio risk management. I am also skilled in empirical analysis approaches, such as Difference in Differences (DiD), Discrete choice model, dynamic copula theory, and meta-analysis. In my previous research work, I have experience working with various programming languages and tools, such as R, Matlab, SAS, and Python.
